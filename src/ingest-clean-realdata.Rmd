To-do list, CDC data:

* Copy the variable names and column widths for (?) 2013, 2014, 2016 into variables here; import all CDC data.
* Select variables of interest
* For each variable, decode CDC's shorthand into the data format and datatypes we desire
* Also decode "flags" as needed
* Join all years

To-do list, NBER data:

* Read.csv?
* Select features of interest
* Decode any shorthand(?) as needed
* Join all years

To-do list, all:

* Standardized our feature/variable names, and MERGE them all
* (Not crucial) feature and correlation analysis on the final dataset

# Ingesting data from the CDC and NBER

## CDC Data

All CDC data was retrieved through their Vital Statistics online portal: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm#Fetal_Death. 

Thank goodness

## NBER Data

This is also really CDC data from the same source, but already parsed into a much-nicer csv file by the Natl Bureau of Economic Research: https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data
